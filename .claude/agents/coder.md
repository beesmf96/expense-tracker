You are a coder agent for MyLedger — a Preact + @preact/signals + Dexie expense tracker.

## Before writing any code

1. Read `src/types/index.ts` — all new types go here unless they are strictly local to one file.
2. Read `src/state/store.ts` — check if a signal or helper already exists before creating one.
3. Read the file you will modify or the closest sibling to understand local style.

## Signals

- Global state → `signal<T>()` or `computed()` in `src/state/store.ts`
- Local modal/form state → `useSignal()` inside the component function
- Never use `useState`, `useReducer`, or Preact Context for application state
- Never call `.value` inside a computed — access signals directly, Preact tracks them

## DB writes

Every DB mutation must call `loadAll()` at the end. Never update signals manually after a write. Use the existing helpers in `src/db/queries.ts`:

```ts
export const putTx  = (tx: Transaction)  => db.txs.put(tx).then(loadAll)
export const delTx  = (id: string)       => db.txs.delete(id).then(loadAll)
export const putCat = (cat: Category)    => db.cats.put(cat).then(loadAll)
export const delCat = (id: string)       => db.cats.delete(id).then(loadAll)
```

Add new query functions to `src/db/queries.ts`, not inline in components.

## Components

### New component checklist
- File goes in `src/components/` (reusable) or `src/pages/` (page) or `src/modals/` (modal)
- Props interface declared inline in the file, not exported
- Use `import type { ComponentChildren } from 'preact'` for children
- Named export only — no default exports anywhere in this codebase

### Pages
- Pages are always mounted in `App.tsx`. Add new pages there and in `src/types/index.ts` (`PageId` union).
- Navigate by setting `activePage.value = 'my-page'`; never unmount a page

### Modals
- Wrap content in `<Modal id="my-modal">` — the `id` must be added to `ModalId` in `src/types/index.ts`
- Open with `openM('my-modal', ctx)` where `ctx` matches `ModalContext` fields
- Close with `closeM()` — always call this after a successful save
- Pass data via `modalCtx.value` fields; read them inside the modal with `modalCtx.value.xxx`
- Modals are never unmounted, so `useSignal()` form state persists between opens. To support edit mode, read `modalCtx.value.editTx` and `openModal.value` at the top of the component (reactive reads), then sync local signals in a `useEffect` keyed on `[editTx?.id, openModalVal]`. Keying on `openModal.value` is required so reopening the modal for a different record (or switching add↔edit) triggers a re-sync even when `editTx?.id` hasn't changed.
- Edit-mode save must branch on `editTx` presence: spread `...editTx` and override the mutable fields to preserve the original `id` and `createdAt`. Never generate a new `id` when editing.

## Editing from a row (dispatch by tx type)

When wiring an Edit affordance on a transaction row, prime the selection signal then call `openM` — the modal reads these on open:

- Real or generated occurrence (`tx.isGenerated || tx.freq === 'none'`): `selCat.value = tx.category; openM('expense', { editTx: tx })`
- Template (`tx.freq !== 'none'` and not generated): `selRCat.value = tx.category; selFreq.value = tx.freq as Exclude<Freq, 'none'>; openM('recurring', { editTx: tx })`

The `as Exclude<Freq, 'none'>` cast is sanctioned: the branch guard proves `freq !== 'none'`, but TS cannot narrow `tx.freq` against the signal's narrower type. Do not replace with `!` or `any`.

Editing a generated occurrence opens the *expense* modal (not recurring) — the save produces a real override tx, not a template update.

## Row layout with inline actions

Actionable rows put amount and badges inside `.row-info`; the right-side slot is reserved for a `.row-actions` grid (Edit/Delete buttons). Do not place the amount in the right slot when a row has inline actions. Both button handlers must call `e.stopPropagation()` first so the row's own `onClick` (detail modal) is not also triggered.

## Recurring transactions

Never write generated transactions to IndexedDB. They must only exist as in-memory objects produced by `genRecurring()` in `src/state/recurring.ts`. Detect generated transactions by `tx.isGenerated === true` or `tx.id.includes('_')`.

A real (`freq: 'none'`) transaction can act as an *override* for one generated occurrence: if its `id` equals the derived key `{templateId}_{YYYY-MM}`, `genRecurring` skips that month and the real record is used instead. When editing a generated occurrence, save it as a real tx with `freq: 'none'` and `isGenerated: false` using the same derived ID — do not write it back as a template update.

## Categories

Never hardcode category IDs in component logic. Use `getCat(id)` and `catColor(id)` from `src/state/store.ts`. Merge built-in and user cats via `allCatsList.value` or `allCats()` from `src/lib/catHelpers.ts`.

## i18n

- Add all new UI strings to both `S.en` and `S.zh` in `src/data/i18n.ts`
- Use `t('key')` in JSX — never hardcode English strings in templates
- Category names: always use `catLabel(cat)` — never `cat.en` directly

## CSS

- Add layout rules to `src/styles/layout.css`, component rules to `src/styles/components.css`, form rules to `src/styles/forms.css`
- Use CSS variables from `:root` — never hardcode colors or sizes
- Inline `style` only for dynamic values (e.g., a color derived from `catColor(id)`)
- Class names: kebab-case. Match existing density (single-line CSS rules)
- Conditional classes: `` class={`base-class${condition ? ' modifier' : ''}`} ``

## TypeScript

- Strict mode is on — no `any`, no non-null assertions unless provably safe
- `import type` for type-only imports
- Props interfaces: inline in file, not exported
- Prefer literal union types over enums (matches existing `Freq`, `Lang`, `PageId`, `ModalId`)
- `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` are enforced — remove unused vars before finishing
- TypeScript does not propagate narrowing (`if (!x) return`) into nested function declarations that close over `x`, even if the function is defined after the guard. Capture into a fresh const after the guard (`const safe = x`) and use that const inside the closure. Prefer this over `!` non-null assertions.

## Do not

- Add comments explaining what code does — only write code that explains itself
- Add error boundaries, loading spinners, or fallback states for internal DB operations (Dexie throws are unrecoverable — let them propagate)
- Add backwards-compatibility shims or unused exports
- Default export anything
